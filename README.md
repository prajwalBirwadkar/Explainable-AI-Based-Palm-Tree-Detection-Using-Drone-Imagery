# Responsible AI Palm-Tree Detection Web App

This project implements a web application for palm tree detection with explainability features using Grad-CAM visualizations. The application is designed to demonstrate responsible AI practices by making the model's decision-making process transparent to users.

## Overview

The web app uses a Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet50 backbone to detect palm trees in uploaded images. It includes the following key components:

1. **Inference module**: Loads a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model to detect palm trees in images
2. **Explainability with Grad-CAM**: Visualizes the regions in the image that most influenced the model's decision
3. **Web interface**: Streamlit-based UI for uploading images and viewing detection results with explanations
4. **Responsible AI features**: Transparency and fairness considerations built into the application

```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure you have the model files in the correct locations:
   - Checkpoint: `MODEL_CHECKPOINTS/model_epoch_14.pth`
   - Weights: `MODEL_WEIGHTS/palm_tree_model.h5`

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The web interface will open in your browser, where you can:
1. Upload an image containing palm trees
2. View detection results with bounding boxes
3. Explore Grad-CAM visualizations for each detection
4. Read about responsible AI considerations

## Extending for Responsible AI Audits

To extend this project for more comprehensive responsible AI audits:

### 1. Bias Detection and Mitigation

- Add code to evaluate model performance across different conditions (lighting, geography, species)
- Implement techniques to mitigate detected biases
- Add analysis of training data distribution

```python
# Example stub for bias detection (to be implemented)
def analyze_model_bias(model, test_datasets):
    """
    Analyze model performance across different datasets to detect bias.
    
    Args:
        model: The detection model
        test_datasets: Dictionary of datasets representing different conditions
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary of performance metrics across datasets
    """
    pass
```

### 2. Model Robustness Testing

- Add adversarial testing to evaluate model robustness
- Implement uncertainty quantification for detections
- Test model performance under various environmental conditions

```python
# Example stub for robustness testing (to be implemented)
def test_model_robustness(model, image, perturbation_types):
    """
    Test model robustness against various perturbations.
    
    Args:
        model: The detection model
        image: Test image
        perturbation_types: List of perturbations to test
        
    Returns:
        Analysis of detection stability
    """
    pass
```

### 3. Data Privacy Analysis

- Add tools to analyze privacy implications of the model
- Implement data minimization techniques
- Add documentation about data handling practices

```python
# Example stub for privacy analysis (to be implemented)
def analyze_privacy_implications(model, dataset):
    """
    Analyze potential privacy implications of the model.
    
    Args:
        model: The detection model
        dataset: Training or test dataset
        
    Returns:
        Privacy risk assessment
    """
    pass
```

## Technical Details

- **Model Architecture**: Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 backbone and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
- **Input**: RGB images in common formats (JPEG, PNG)
- **Output**: Bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and Grad-CAM visualizations
- **Performance**: Inference time depends on image size and hardware (CPU/GPU)
